Welcome to the Good Software Delivery (GSD) course.

This lesson downloads the lastet copy of the GSD repo: https://github.com/contino/gsd-hello-world and provides an environment where you can take it for a test drive.

The GSD (Good Software Delivery) "Hello World" app is written in Golang and wrapped in Docker via [3 Musketeers](https://3musketeers.io/).

It's a **demo of how you might implement a set of concepts that make up a "Trust and Verify" pipeline**, which is a concept within the practice of GSD.
