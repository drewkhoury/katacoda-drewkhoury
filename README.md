# Tips

### Resources

View the [Katacoda documentation](https://www.katacoda.com/docs) for information on how to edit environments, scenarios and more. [scenario-examples](https://github.com/katacoda/scenario-examples) github.

### Basic Katacoda Syntax in markdown

#### Open a file

```
`relative/path/to/file.foo`{{open}}
```

#### Replace file

```
<pre class="file" data-filename="relative/path/to/file.foo" data-target="replace">
you
multi
line
content
</pre>
```

#### Execute a command

```
`your command`{{execute}}
```

### Deployments

Useful dashboard links to verify that deployments were successful:

- https://dashboard.katacoda.com/content/
- https://dashboard.katacoda.com/content/testruns/
- https://dashboard.katacoda.com/content/debug/
  
It can take 1 minute, or 20 minutes for deployed courses to show up on your profile.
  
You can inspect the page and look for "gitCommit" to verify what deployment you're seeing, eg: `<meta name="gitCommit" content="2ef3f7244365837307f9003875e0746f9cd3e825">`

### Viewing your own lesson / debug

When viewing your own lesson you can access debug from the "SCENARIO AUTHORING INFORMATION" link at the top of the page.

e.g: if your background script is downloading software through apt it might look like this:

```
Warning: Permanently added 'host01,172.17.0.12' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts. WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts. Reading package lists... Building dependency tree... Reading state information... The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: libc-ares2 libnetplan0 nodejs-doc python3-netifaces Use 'apt autoremove' to remove them. The following additional packages will be installed: ant ant-optional antlr bnd groovy ivy java-wrappers junit4 libantlr-java �� libasm-java libbcel-java libbcpg-java libbcprov-java libbindex-java libbsf-java libbsh-java libcommons-codec-java libcommons-collections3-java � libcommons-compress-java libcommons-lang-java libcommons-logging-java lib
```

### Displaying a Progress Spinner / Wait Script

Example from katacoda: [scenario-examples/displaying-progress-spinner](https://github.com/katacoda/scenario-examples/tree/main/displaying-progress-spinner)

In [foreground.sh](https://github.com/katacoda/scenario-examples/blob/main/displaying-progress-spinner/foreground.sh) they use a `sleep 1` however that could fail (might take a few seconds to load the foreground script). Use this instead:
  
```
while [ ! -f /usr/local/bin/wait.sh ]
do
  sleep 0.2
done
```

Here's an example of how to include the wait script (which needs to be done on the host) alongside other assets in `index.json`:
```
    "assets": {
      "client": [{
        "file": "*",
        "target": "~/"
      }],
        "host01": [
            {"file": "wait.sh", "target": "/usr/local/bin/", "chmod": "+x"}
        ]
    }  
```
  
### VS Code Layout
 
https://www.katacoda.community/essentials/layouts.html
  
At the moment, VS Code integration is only supported in our **Ubuntu based environments** but this is being rolled out across all our environments.

### Relative path for files when interacting with editor

You may want to use relative links in your markdown, as well as having a default folder accessable in your IDE.
  
Let's assume you have the following folder structure in your repo for `scenario-foo`: `assets/folder/path/to/your/app` then you would set your `uieditorpath` to:
 
```
  "environment": {
    "uieditorpath": "/root/folder/path/to/your/app"
  },  
```

Then you can do things like this:

```
`relative/path/to/file.foo`{{open}}
```
  
Instead of:

```
`/root/folder/path/to/your/app/relative/path/to/file.foo`{{open}}
```
  
### Sample `index.json`

This is an example of an `index.json` skeleton.

Files that need to live in the root of the lesson repo (alongside `index.json`):  

- steps/intro/finish: `*.md`
- courseData: `background.sh` (katacoda runs this script you specify in the background on lesson-start)
- code: `foreground.sh` (katacoda runs this script you specify in the forground on lesson-start)

Files that need to live in the `assets/` folder in the lesson repo:
  
- `wait.sh` this needs to be available in the terminal (if you want to support progress spinner feature), so we include it in `assets/` and copy it to `host01`
- anything else we need available for our lesson, in our example we have `assets/folder/path/to/your/app` which contains our application
