Welcome to the start of your TDD journey. Please be patient as your enviorment loads, it usually takes less than a minute.

## TDD Starts with a test file

TDD starts with testing before any development.

Open the file `src/test/java/StudentTest.java`{{open}}.

As you can see, there's not not much here yet. Our first task is to write our first JUnit test.

## Write your first test

Write your first test to define what you'd like to happen, this is what you expect to happen once the code has been written.

For our first test we're going to create a `StudentTest` class and create a test that asserts `studentName` is equal to the concatination of the student's first and last name when we call our Student function (note there's no code in our student function so we expect this test will fail).

Copy the following into the editor by hitting 'copy to editor':

<pre class="file" data-filename="src/test/java/StudentTest.java" data-target="replace">
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class StudentTest {
  @Test
  public void givenStudentName_ThenReturnDisplayName() {
    Student student = new Student();
    String studentName = student.displayStudentName("John", "Smith");
    assertEquals("JohnSmith", studentName);
  }
}
</pre>

## Run your first test (Red)

Let's now run our test! We're expecting that this will be "red" or "fail" as we've only written the test (we'll make it pass in the next step).

Click execute to run your first test:

`bash ./gradlew test`{{execute}}

Now you're ready for the part everyone loves, making things green! Click continue when you're ready.
